My several trials of predicting the traffic flow at toll stations using machine learning and deep learning approaches as part of my second intern project

The ML models do not predict well.
The T-GCN model is successfully, with an accuracy rate of 75 Â± 2%, outperforming the model trained using the data from shenzhen in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05320?context=stat.ML
